## Introduction

Chocolate, a universal delight that transcends borders and cultures. But behind every delectable bite lies a dynamic world of sales, revenue streams, and customer preferences. To understand the key drivers of success in this chocolate retail shop, we embarked on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using MySQL, uncovering trends that influence profitability. Through meticulous data cleaning and transformation, we cleaned the dataset to extract compelling insights and recommendations to boost future performance.


## Data Cleaning and Transformation

Before diving into analysis, it was crucial to structure and refine the raw data. Key steps included:

Creating a duplicate table for EDA named re_choco_sales, which was populated with essential data.

* Check thoroughly for the empty columns and duplicate rows.

* Renaming some columns to more appropriate and meaningful names for clarity.

* Formatting the Amount and Date column to match their correct data types.

* Converting the Date column from text format into an actual date using the STRING_TO_DATE function and updating the respective column.

* Transforming the Amount from text to decimal format by removing currency symbols using the SUBSTRING function before updating it into the Amount column.

* Detecting and addressing duplicate values to ensure accuracy in analysis.

With the dataset cleaned and transformed, we proceeded to uncover valuable insights that would paint a clearer picture of the chocolate retail sales landscape.
